"""One-time seed of the product catalog into Milvus.

`search_products` (rag_tools.py) does a vector search over the `product_catalog`
collection; that collection has to be created and populated once per cluster.
The already-deployed customer-agent pod carries everything the seed needs
(fastembed + pymilvus + the pre-baked model cache + MILVUS_URI), so run this
script INSIDE that pod by piping it over stdin — no extra image or rebuild:

    kubectl exec -i deploy/customer-agent -n default -- python - \\
      < modules/500-agent-tools-mcp/customer-agent/seed_products.py

Idempotent: re-running drops and recreates the collection, so editing the
product list below and re-running reseeds cleanly.
