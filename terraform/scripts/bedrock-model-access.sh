# Enable Bedrock model access for the Anthropic Claude models the coding agent
# uses. Anthropic models on Bedrock are delivered through AWS Marketplace, so
# the account must hold a foundation-model agreement (subscription) before they
# can be invoked — WITHOUT it the /anthropic gateway route returns 403
# AccessDenied ("aws-marketplace:ViewSubscriptions, Subscribe"), even though
# bedrock:InvokeModel is granted. First-party models (Amazon Nova) need none of
# this, so they work regardless.
#
# The models are invoked through CROSS-REGION inference profiles (us.anthropic.*),
# which route to us-east-1 / us-east-2 / us-west-2, so we subscribe in each. This
# is best-effort and IDEMPOTENT: "already exists" is success, and a region the
# account cannot use (e.g. an SCP-restricted region) is logged and skipped rather
# than failing the apply. Requires the caller to hold aws-marketplace:Subscribe +
# bedrock:CreateFoundationModelAgreement; if it does not, this prints guidance and
# exits 0 (enable model access manually in the Bedrock console → Model access).
