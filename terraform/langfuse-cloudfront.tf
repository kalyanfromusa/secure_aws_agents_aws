# CloudFront + internal ALB for Langfuse
#
# Langfuse used to be published by the Helm chart's own Ingress: an
# internet-facing ALB on plaintext HTTP:80, with inbound-cidrs 0.0.0.0/0 in the
# Workshop Studio path. That put a tracing backend holding every prompt and
# completion on the open internet, protected only by its login form, and it
# blocked internal dry runs, where public HTTP endpoints are not allowed.
#
# CIDR scoping is not an option here: Workshop Studio vends accounts
# continuously and participants connect from arbitrary addresses, so there is no
# list to write. Instead the ALB is INTERNAL (private subnets, no public IP) and
# CloudFront reaches it through a VPC origin. Participants get HTTPS on the
# *.cloudfront.net cert, and the load balancer itself is unreachable from the
# internet, not merely firewalled.
#
# This differs from cloudfront.tf / gitea-cloudfront.tf, which use
# internet-facing ALBs restricted to the CloudFront prefix list. Those predate
# VPC origins. Same effect for a caller; this one is stricter, because there is
# no public listener to reach at all.
#
# Reuses the data sources declared in cloudfront.tf (the two AWS-managed
# CloudFront policies). The CloudFront prefix list is not needed: a VPC origin
# is authorized by security group, not by source IP.
################################################################################

# The ALB is private, so the only thing that may reach it is CloudFront's VPC
# origin ENI. Authorization is by security group: see
# aws_security_group_rule.langfuse_alb_from_cloudfront for which group, and why
# the rules here are standalone rather than inline.
