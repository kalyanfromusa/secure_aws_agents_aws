# StatefulSet PVC retention — clickhouse + zookeeper
#
# The other volumeClaimTemplate PVCs get whenDeleted=Delete through chart values
# (postgresql and redis above, milvus etcd in addons.tf). ClickHouse cannot: chart
# 8.0.5 and its bundled zookeeper subchart have NO persistentVolumeClaimRetention
# Policy support at all — not in values.yaml, not in the StatefulSet templates. So
# data-langfuse-clickhouse-shard0-0 and data-langfuse-zookeeper-0 (8Gi each) would
# survive `helm uninstall`, and with them their EBS volumes.
#
# Patching the field directly does the same thing the chart values would: the
# StatefulSet controller adds an ownerReference to each PVC, so deleting the
# StatefulSet garbage-collects the PVC and the StorageClass's Delete reclaim drops
# the volume. It is a mutable field, so patching after install is fine, and the
# ownerReferences are in place from here on — nothing has to happen at destroy time
# for them to be collected.
#
# Applied to EVERY StatefulSet in the namespace rather than to hardcoded names:
# the clickhouse StatefulSet name carries a shard index, and re-patching the two
# already covered by values is a no-op. Runs at create time only.
#
# Depends directly on helm_release.langfuse (the chart-render/install step),
# NOT on null_resource.langfuse_wait_and_enable. All of these StatefulSet
# OBJECTS are created synchronously as part of the Helm install itself — their
# PODS becoming Ready is a separate, later concern that wait_and_enable
# additionally verifies, but the objects `kubectl get statefulset` looks for
# below already exist by the time helm_release.langfuse's own apply/install
# call returns, with or without that release's `wait` flag. Depending on
# wait_and_enable instead would mean this patch — the ONLY thing that lets
# clickhouse/zookeeper's PVCs get reclaimed on destroy — never runs at all if
# that long migration/scale-up workflow fails for an unrelated reason (e.g. a
# web pod crash), even though the StatefulSets (and their PVCs) already exist.

# ALIAS the agents pass (nova-lite, claude-sonnet, ...), NOT the real Bedrock ID
# the Envoy AI Gateway rewrites to on the wire. None of these aliases are in
# Langfuse's built-in price list, so without this every generation shows blank
# cost. We POST one model definition per alias via the public API.
#
# Prices are per-TOKEN USD, sourced from the LiteLLM community cost map for the
# real Bedrock model each alias maps to (us-region rate where it differs). See
# the alias -> model mapping in manifests/envoy-ai-gateway-bedrock.yaml. RE-VERIFY
# against the live AWS Bedrock pricing page if absolute cost accuracy matters;
# the workshop's point is that cost SHOWS UP, keyed to the friendly alias.

# exactly (e.g. `nova-lite` does not also swallow a future `nova-lite-v2`).
